Note-ify is a Firefox add-on created by [jen hill](http://jh-sound.com) for [RAGE thormbones](http://www.ragethormbones.rocks/) that turns any website into musical notation.

To install Note-ify, visit www.jenhill.art/note-ify-4.3.xpi using Mozilla Firefox web browser


After installing the add-on, simply ctrl+click or two-finger click anywhere on a webpage and select "Note-ify!" from the context menu and enjoy the beautiful music. To return to unmusical web browsing, simply refresh the page.


'Note-ify’ is rooted in the lineage of experimental notation in western art music as well as in a confrontation of the browser-as-medium. By translating online content into musical material, ’Note-ify’ exposes the complex underlying mechanisms of both web browser and western notation, forcing a reconstruction their signifying structures and contexts. 

Structurally, ’Note-ify’ is a browser extension for Mozilla Firefox that converts a website’s text content into an abstract, absurdist, unreadable, and generally unperformable musical score. Its presentation may take any number of forms including purely visual print media, live web-browser-performance, and musical performance of the literal notation-as-score -- with the catch that any interpretation involving measurable production of sound within range of the computer’s audio input will trigger the cumulative deletion of the notation itself, punishing certain approaches to the work. Via an aesthetics of absurdity, ‘Note-ify’ thrives as an unrealized imagining of an impossible music.

Although originally conceived of as a musical composition commissioned by the trombone duo Rage Thormbones, ‘Note-ify’ has grown into a project which now lives somewhere in the midst of net.art, experimental musical notation, and non-cochlear performance-sound-art.
